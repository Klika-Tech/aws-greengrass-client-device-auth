@GGMQ
Feature: GGMQ-1

  As a developer, I can configure my client agents to connect and use MQTT

  Background:
    Given my device is registered as a Thing
    And my device is running Greengrass

  Scenario: GGMQ-1-T1: As a customer, I can connect, subscribe, publish and receive using client application to MQTT topic
    When I create a Greengrass deployment with components
      | aws.greengrass.clientdevices.Auth        | LATEST                                                        |
      | aws.greengrass.clientdevices.mqtt.EMQX   | LATEST                                                        |
      | aws.greengrass.clientdevices.IPDetector  | LATEST                                                        |
      | aws.greengrass.client.Mqtt5JavaSdkClient | classpath:/greengrass/components/recipes/client_java_sdk.yaml |
    And I create client device "clientDeviceTest"
    When I associate "clientDeviceTest" with ggc
    And I update my Greengrass deployment configuration, setting the component aws.greengrass.clientdevices.Auth configuration to:
    """
